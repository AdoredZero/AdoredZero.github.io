        <p>Medical Marijuana is a controversial but very real topic we face to day in society. This website includes information on laws and resources regarding the growing cannabis industry. Whether you are new to cannabis or a seasoned veteran, we can help you locate the resources available to you.</p>
        <p>Medical marijuana patients with a valid Medical Marijuana Authorization may join the medical marijuana authorization database and get a medical marijuana card from a medically endorsed marijuana retail store (PDF). This allows you to grow six plants by default in the system and up to 15 plants if authorized by your healthcare practitioner, and allows you to purchase marijuana products sales and use-tax free.
